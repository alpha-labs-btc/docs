# ðŸ¤º Risk Warning

Please be careful! Thereâ€™s a risk of frontrunning in the mempool when creating sought-after Rune assets.

When the network is congested, minting new Rune assets could potentially lead to a loss of funds. Network congestion is often caused by the creation of in-demand Rune assets.

If the fee rate for your transaction is too low, your transaction might not get confirmed until the creation event is fully completed. In such a case, you wonâ€™t receive any Rune assets and the network fee youâ€™ve paid will not be returned.

This frontrunning phenomenon is a result of the way Bitcoin miners handle transactions. They create blocks by including transactions based on the highest network fee rate. Transactions with higher fee rates get priority, even if they were submitted later.
