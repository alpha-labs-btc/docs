# ❓ What is PSBTs ?

Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) are a data format that allows wallets and other tools to exchange information about a Bitcoin transaction and the signatures necessary to complete it

&#x20;A PSBT can be created that identifies a set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to spend and a set of outputs to receive that spent value.

RuneAlpha’s marketplace is harnessing the power of PSBTs in some pretty rad ways:

* **Multi-party Transactions**: PSBTs are perfect for getting multiple parties to sign off on the same transaction. We can mix and match signatures from buyers and sellers, then broadcast the result to the Bitcoin network. It’s secure and saves users a bundle.
* **Offline Signing**: PSBTs come with handy metadata that helps devices check the addresses and amounts involved in a transaction they’re signing. This means sellers can list their items at a lower transaction cost, update anytime, and still keep their assets safe and sound. It’s all about that Bitcoin life, right?
