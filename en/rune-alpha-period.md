# 🏹 Rune Alpha Period

The Rune protocol is currently in the pre-launch phase, with our dedicated Chef team meticulously crafting an Alpha version. This preliminary version is designed to meet the exacting standards of the upcoming mainnet release. This demo is intended for those who are at the forefront of technology adoption, the true "Alphas."

* The protocol is currently adhering to the ordinal version 0.11.1, which can be found in the commit history on the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/0xmodule/ord/commits/master](https://github.com/0xmodule/ord/commits/master)
* The protocol signature has been updated to `RUNE_ALPHA`.
* The mainnet can be scanned at the following URL: [scan.runealpha.xyz](https://scan.runealpha.xyz/). For the testnet, please use this URL: [testnet-scan.runealpha.xyz](https://testnet-scan.runealpha.xyz/)
